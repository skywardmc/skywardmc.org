Additive changes a couple mod configs out of the box. Most of these are just small tweaks. For example, disabling Better Grass out of the box so you have to enable it manually.

This page is a little less technical than Adrenaline's config changes page, as there are much more differences between Additive variants and it's a bit harder to keep track of.
