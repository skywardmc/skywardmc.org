Hammer is a lightweight, open-source modpack for (Neo)Forge that significantly improves Minecraft render and logic performance through various different mods and configurations.

The aim of this project is to be a port of [Adrenaline](/adrenaline) to (Neo)Forge. It uses [Sinytra](https://sinytra.org/) along with native Forge ports.

Hammer's wiki is currently a work-in-progress.

For more information, read through Hammer's [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/project/hammer) page.
