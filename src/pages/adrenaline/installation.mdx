You can install Adrenaline through our free and open-source installer by clicking the button below. Alternatively, if you want to install Additive through a third-party launcher, or on your server, follow [Modrinth's documentation](https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8802250-modpacks-on-modrinth).

The Additive installer works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. If you can't open the installer, try running `java -jar additive-installer-1.0.3.jar` in a terminal. You need Java installed.

To install Adrenaline instead of Additive in the installer, make sure that you uncheck "Include non-performance features". Keeping this checked will install Additive.
