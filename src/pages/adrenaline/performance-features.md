Adrenaline utilizes various performance mods to improve the game's logic and rendering speed significantly, while being carefully designed to not include unnecessary fluff that could cause issues. Here is a list of mods that are included with Adrenaline, excluding library mods.

> ### Adrenaline can be used on both clients or servers.
>
> Adrenaline utilizes `mrpack`'s environment feature. Mods are either determined client-side, server-side, or both, which is carefully chosen based on overhead, purpose, and relevance.
>
> If you install Adrenaline through a **launcher**, such as Prism Launcher or the Modrinth App, it will only install the mods that are marked as **client-side** or **both-side**.
>
> If you install Adrenaline through an **installer designed to be used to manage servers**, such as mrpack-install or Docker Minecraft Server, it will only install the mods that are marked as **server-side** or **both-side**.

> ### Why aren't all of these server-side mods installed client-side?
>
> A few of these mods could cause issues when installed on the client, such as Krypton breaking certain connections. Along with that, pretty much none of them need to be installed client-side as they do not typically offer much of a benefit at all, unless you have your integrated server open to LAN and multiple players are active.
>
> For those reasons, they are not automatically installed client-side. Carefully stripping out unnecessary mods results in less compatibility issues and improved stability, which follows one of Adrenaline's goals: remaining stable.
>
> C2ME may be one exception if you add extra mods regarding world generation, which is explained on the [post-install](/adrenaline/post-install) page.
